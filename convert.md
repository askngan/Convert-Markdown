It's possible to put all the code into one Python file. However, if the file becomes too long and complex, it might be better to split the code into separate modules for better organization and maintainability.

In this case, you could split the code into the following modules:

pdf_to_md.py - contains the main function to convert PDF to Markdown
pdf_parser.py - contains functions to extract text, tables, and images from a PDF file
md_writer.py - contains functions to write Markdown output to a file
You could then import these modules into a main Python script and call the main function from the pdf_to_md.py module to convert the PDF file to Markdown.

Here's an example of how the code could be structured:

Copy code
pdf_to_md/
├── pdf_to_md.py
├── pdf_parser.py
├── md_writer.py
└── example.pdf
In the main pdf_to_md.py file, you could have the following code:

python
Copy code
from pdf_parser import extract_text, extract_tables, extract_images
from md_writer import write_md_file

def pdf_to_md(input_file, output_file):
    # Extract text, tables, and images from PDF file
    text = extract_text(input_file)
    tables = extract_tables(input_file)
    images = extract_images(input_file)

    # Write Markdown output to file
    write_md_file(output_file, text, tables, images)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example usage
    pdf_to_md('example.pdf', 'example.md')
In the pdf_parser.py module, you could have functions to extract text, tables, and images from the PDF file using PyMuPDF. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
import fitz

def extract_text(input_file):
    doc = fitz.open(input_file)
    text = ""

    for page in doc:
        text += page.getText()

    return text

def extract_tables(input_file):
    # Code to extract tables from PDF using PyMuPDF

def extract_images(input_file):
    # Code to extract images from PDF using PyMuPDF
In the md_writer.py module, you could have functions to write the Markdown output to a file. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
def write_md_file(output_file, text, tables, images):
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        f.write('\n\n')

        for table in tables:
            f.write(table)
            f.write('\n\n')

        for image in images:
            f.write(f'![{image["alt_text"]}](data:image/png;base64,{image["base64_data"]})')
            f.write('\n\n')
Of course, these are just examples, and you could modify the code to suit your specific needs.
