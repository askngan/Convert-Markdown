As an API architect and project manager, here are some general steps that you may consider when planning a migration from IBM API Connect v2018 Apr to version 10.0.5:

1.Review the API Connect version 10.0.5 documentation and release notes to understand the new features, changes, and requirements of the new version. This will help you to identify any potential compatibility issues or changes in configuration that may need to be addressed during the migration.

2. Assess the current state of your API Connect implementation, including any customizations, extensions, and integrations that are in use. This will help you to identify any potential risks, challenges, or areas of focus for the migration.

3. Plan and prepare your migration environment, including the hardware, software, and network resources needed to support the migration process. This may include setting up a test or staging environment to validate the migration before applying it to the production environment.

4. Develop a migration plan that outlines the steps, tasks, and dependencies needed to migrate from the current version to version 10.0.5. This plan should include the following:

- Pre-migration tasks, such as backing up data, stopping services, and verifying system requirements.
- Migration tasks, such as upgrading the software, migrating data, and testing the environment.
- Post-migration tasks, such as verifying the migration, testing functionality, and configuring new features.

5. Execute the migration plan, following the defined tasks and dependencies. This may involve coordinating with different teams or stakeholders, such as developers, testers, and system administrators.

6. Test the migrated environment thoroughly to ensure that all APIs, services, and integrations are working as expected. This may involve creating test cases, executing regression tests, and validating the functionality of the new features.

7. Monitor and optimize the migrated environment to ensure that it is performing efficiently and effectively. This may involve tuning the system settings, monitoring the logs, and addressing any issues or errors that arise.

8. Communicate the migration process and status to relevant stakeholders, such as management, users, and partners. This may involve documenting the migration plan, providing status updates, and addressing any concerns or questions that arise.

Overall, the migration process from IBM API Connect v2018 Apr to version 10.0.5 will require careful planning, preparation, and execution to ensure a smooth and successful transition. By following these general steps and adapting them to your specific requirements and circumstances, you can minimize risks, optimize resources, and achieve the desired outcomes of your migration project.





Q: I need the plan break down to technical level at least dowtime.  Any canary release , blue/green test or A/B test can suggest ?

There is a breakdown of the technical steps for migrating from IBM API Connect v2018 Apr to version 10.0.5, along with some considerations for minimizing downtime and implementing canary releases or other testing strategies:

1. Pre-migration tasks:
- Verify that your existing environment meets the system requirements for version 10.0.5, including hardware, software, and network configurations.
- Back up any important data or configurations, including APIs, products, and policies.
- Notify users and stakeholders about the migration plan, including any expected downtime or disruptions.

2. Set up a test or staging environment to simulate the production environment and test the migration process. This can help identify potential issues and validate the migration plan before applying it to the production environment.
3. Upgrade IBM API Connect to version 10.0.5 on the test or staging environment. Follow the upgrade guide provided by IBM to ensure a smooth and successful upgrade.
4. Test the migrated environment thoroughly, including testing all APIs, products, and policies, as well as any customizations or integrations. Use automated testing tools to speed up the testing process and minimize errors.
5. Plan the migration strategy for the production environment. Depending on the level of risk and downtime tolerance, you may consider implementing one or more of the following strategies:
- Canary release: Roll out the new version to a small subset of users or APIs first, and gradually increase the rollout over time as you validate the migration and ensure no major issues or errors arise.
- Blue/green deployment: Set up a duplicate environment with version 10.0.5 alongside the existing environment with version 2018 Apr. Route traffic to the new environment gradually, and monitor the performance and functionality of the APIs and services.
- A/B testing: Deploy both versions simultaneously, and route traffic to each version based on specific criteria, such as user or API ID, location, or load balancing. Compare the performance and functionality of each version to determine which one is better.
6.Execute the migration plan on the production environment, following the strategy you selected. Monitor the logs and metrics to ensure that everything is working as expected.
7. Validate the migrated environment thoroughly, including testing all APIs, products, and policies, as well as any customizations or integrations. Use automated testing tools to speed up the testing process and minimize errors.
8. Optimize the migrated environment by tuning the system settings, monitoring the logs, and addressing any issues or errors that arise.
9. Notify users and stakeholders about the completion of the migration, and provide any necessary training or support for using the new features or functionality.

As for downtime, it will depend on the migration strategy you select and the size and complexity of your environment. A canary release or blue/green deployment can minimize downtime by gradually rolling out the new version and detecting issues before they impact the entire environment. A/B testing may require more downtime to switch between versions and compare performance.

Overall, the key to a successful migration is careful planning, testing, and validation, along with communication and collaboration with all stakeholders. By following these steps and implementing the right migration strategy for your environment, you can minimize risks, optimize resources, and achieve a smooth and successful migration to IBM API Connect v10.0.5.
